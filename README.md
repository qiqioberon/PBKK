## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Cloning and Setting Up the Project

To get started with this Laravel project, follow these steps after cloning the repository:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qiqioberon/PBKK
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Next, install the required PHP dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment File
Copy the example environment configuration file `.env.example` to a new `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 4. Generate Application Key
Generate the application encryption key. This key is used by Laravel to encrypt data and should be unique for every project:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This will set the `APP_KEY` value in your `.env` file.

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
Open the `.env` file and configure your environment settings, such as the database connection, caching, and queue drivers. Make sure you set up your database connection correctly:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 6. Run Migrations
If the project uses a database, you’ll need to run the migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 7. (Optional) Install NPM Dependencies
If the project includes frontend dependencies (like Vue.js, React, or Tailwind CSS), you’ll need to install them using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 8. Compile Frontend Assets (Optional)
If applicable, compile the frontend assets using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production builds, use:

```bash
npm run prod
```

### 9. Serve the Application
Finally, start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
